Getting Started
---------------
To get started you'll fork this project.

Commit each exercise when you're done with it.

Exercise #1
-----------
Create a page with header, footer and main section in index.html. The main section should contain a content section and a sidebar. Set the width of the content section to 70% and the sidebar section to 30%. The sidebar should appear on the right hand side of the content section.

index.html should include these scripts:

- `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js`
- `test.js`
- `test.css`

The header section should contain a nav with three links:

- Home ( index.html )
- About ( /about )
- Blog ( /blog )
