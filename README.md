UI exercise
==============================

Overview
--------

The logic you employ and the approach you take to solve the problem are the most interesting to us. Each of the given problems have at least a handful of valid solutions, and possibly other solutions weʼve never seen. So, donʼt worry about finding "the" solution. You should NOT use any 3rd party plugins to solve any of the exercises besides the jQuery URL provided. You can use any IDE or code editor you choose, any browser for testing your code (we recommend Chrome or Firefox).

Getting Started
---------------
To get started you'll fork this project.

Commit each exercise when you're done with it.

Exercise #1
-----------
Create an **HTML5** page with header, footer and main sections in index.html. The main section should contain a content section and a sidebar. Set the width of the content section to 660 pixels and the sidebar section to 300 pixels. Make the sidebar float to the right side of the content section.

Index.html should include these scripts:

- `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js`
- `test.js`
- `test.css`

The header section should contain a nav with three links:

- Home ( index.html )
- About ( /about )
- Blog ( /blog )
    
Exercise #2
-----------

Style the header in whatever way you think suits.

In the content section of index.html, rebuild this design in HTML5 and CSS3. You don't need to perfectly match exact pixel sizes, fonts, or colors for this exercise but it should look as similar as possible. You can also use lorem-ipsum or placeholder text.

Exercise #3
-----------
Make a new link called "Sidebar" in the header that hides and shows a sidebar 3 seconds after you click on it. 

Finish Up
---------
Commit your changes into git and push them back to the server.

Send us a link to your fork in GitHub and you're all done!
